PICFLOAT: http://picfloat.sourceforge.net , by Mike Gore

Assumptions:
	This project was developed on Linux with the GPUTILS,GCC and developer 
	tools installed.
	Windows users can use CYGWIN with GPUTILS, GCC and developer tools
	installed.
	I used gpasm-0.11.8 alpha from CVS dated after DEC3rd from GPUTILS

See: 
	CYGWIN:	 http://cygwin.com/
	GPUTILS: http://gputils.sourceforge.net , Craig Franklin and Scott Dattalo

Notes:
	The floating point code itself is written in assembly code and uses gpasm 
	from the GPUTILS tools set. The test suite based on PARANOIA and PSIM, 
	which verifies,  correct operation, is written in C, as are the conversion 
	routines, and uses the  GCC tool chain to compile. Included is a modified 
	copy of the pic simulator PSIM and PARANOIA.

Compiling:

	To compile build the project run "make all" at the shell prompt
	(make is part of the developer tools)
