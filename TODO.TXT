- Better Documentation
	Note: see program mkdocs
	All entry point labels have has a ':' and all MACRO have
    a preceding line has a comment so mkdocs can extract these into a file

- Fix spelling

- Verify that all of the MACRO names follow a consistent naming convention

- Consider adding banking code for large projects
 	Note: the original code was planned to be non-banked with high level 
    function such as trig,log,io functions emulated from EEPROM - banking
	added overhead to the size of the core functions

- Add more support for index register and simulated stack memory access 
	Note: original core code was targeted to non index Register processors 
    Use of index register has been limited to memory move and table load 
    functions so far 
	- Consider adding index register for unary functions (INDF)
	- Consider adding simulated stack for floating point objects

- Do more testing of all functions in fpfn.asm
	I.E. Using random operands as compared against the host using PSIM 
	See tests directory for more details

- Finish testing ATOF for more cases	- improve ram usage
- Finish testing ATOI for more cases	- improve ram usage

- Add Math Functions
	(All very trivial to do)
	LOG10(X)
	POW10(X)
	SINH(x)
	COSH(x)
	TANH(x)
