Numbers Formats used in the picfloat project

Temporary Real Numbers are used for internal floating point registers

<SIGN> <EXP> <MANTISSA>
7..0   7..0  31..0

Byte Offsets
MAN     equ     0
MAN_LSB equ     0
MAN_MSB equ     3
EXP     equ     4
SIGN    equ     5

Exponent:
	The exponent is biased by 127 as per the IEEE754 specs for
single precision numbers - so 1.0 has an exponent of 127 - values less
then 127 are negative exponents (i.e. fractional numbers). The value of
one would have avalue of the MSB set to 1 (MAN_MSB above)
The number zero has the reserved exponent value of 0.  
The purpose of this format is to arrange numbers in a lexical order 
so an ascii string comparison of to floating point numbers will yield 
the correct result for a compare.


Sign:
        The sign is 128 for negative numbers and 0 for positive numbers

Mantissa:
        32 bit number - note the IEEE754 spec calls for 23 bits for a single
precision number - these extra bits help provide the guard bits that ensure
better accuracy when doing intermediate calculations.

Notes: Values are converted to and from this Temporary real format when
loading or storing IEEE32 bit numbers
