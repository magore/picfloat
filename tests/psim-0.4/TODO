should silently proceed past them; the trace command shouldn't show them.
Of course, they should still be added to the cycle count.

add breakreason arg to dobreak and define suitable constants

add history/traceback

add "next" (i.e., step over) command

reset

interrupts

make video parameters run-time configurable
