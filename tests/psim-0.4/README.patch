The file psim.patch patches the original psim-0.4 to allow its
core functions to be placed in a library so they could be compiled into
user programs. Additinal code was added so users program could "call" pic
functions in the simulator - this permits complex testing in a host
enviornment that would not be possible othersie

For the orginal code consult http://sourceforge.net/projects/psim
