What is PSIM
------------

PSIM is a extremely simplistic simulator for the Microchip PIC16Cxx series of
microcontrollers.  I wrote it because I was unable to find an existing
simulator which met my needs:

  Portable: I need to work under Linux on Intel and Alpha systems)
  Extensible:  I need to simulate specialized I/O devices, such as video output
  Reasonably fast
  Source code publicly available


What isn't PSIM
---------------

PSIM is *not* commercial quality software, or anywhere close.  It is a very
early release that is only suitable for people who are willing to do some
hacking.

PSIM currently doesn't simulate much in the way of I/O.  It mainly simulates
the CPU core.  However, there is optional code that simulates a not-quite-NTSC
video output.

Note that PSIM was just a quick hack, and although I'd like to make a lot
of improvements to it, there is no guarantee that I actually will.  However,
I'd be delighted to integrate any improvements that you make.

Although the PSIM code is believed to be reasonably portable, I haven't
actually tried to build it under DOS, Windows, etc.


Performance
-----------

The non-video version of PSIM can simulate 950,000 instruction cycles per
second on a Pentium Pro 150 (i.e., almost as fast as a 4 MHz PIC).
